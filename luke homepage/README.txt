A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/blindingstars/pen/wBexpr.

 Nearly all image-free except for backgrounds. Best viewed in Chrome (due to background-clip in 2 examples).

Webfonts all served by Google Fonts. Patterns via subtlepatterns and used with love.

NOTES FOR PRESSED & CANDY: Yes, they're a weird. Using :before and :after because there was a weird stacking order and I couldn't get the shadow on top of the section background using only one pseudo-element.
